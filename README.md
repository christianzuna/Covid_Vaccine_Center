    - docker ps to check the container name
  3. docker exec -it hopeful-blabla psql -U postgres
- use gradle command lines to clean and build the war file

  2. gradle build 
- locate the 'build' folder that was generated by gradle under 'lib' folder
- search for 'lib.war' under 'libs' folder, then right click on it to run it with the Tomcat server extension in Vscode
- Vscode will search for the core apache-tomcat zip folder downloaded from 'https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi' 
  - make sure to add a postgresql driver (postgresql-42.2.20.jar file) downloaded from 'https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html'; dump this file into ~/apache-tomcat/lib folder
